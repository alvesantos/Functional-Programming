# Sum Types Practice

Doc2Doc should be able to prepare and export a CSV file of whatever data you input. CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a ubiquitous text format that allows for inofrmation to be structured in a table. There is usually a header row, followed by data rows. Within rows, items are separated by commas.

## Assignment

Complete the `get_csv_status` function. It should use a `match` statement to select the correct response depending on the status of the export operation. Create functions to handle each operation as follows:

1. [ ] `PENDING`: return a tuple with the string `"Pending..."` and the raw table data converted from a list of lists of anything, to a prepared list of lists of strings.
   1. [ ] Try to use nested `map` functions to convert the data items into strings.
   2. [ ] Remember to convert from a `map` object back into a list.
2. [ ] `PROCESSING`: return a tuple with the string `"Processing..."` and the prepared list of lists of strings converted to one CSV-formatted string.
   1. [ ] For each list of strings, combine the strings with `join` with commas in between to form a row.
   2. [ ] For each row string, combine the strings with `join` with newlines (`"\n"`) in between to form a table.
3. [ ] `SUCCESS`: return a tuple with the string `"Success!"` and the data as-is.
4. [ ] `FAILURE`: return a tuple with the string `"Unknown error, retrying..."` and the data after it's been prepared and processed into a CSV string, by comibining the steps for `PENDING` and `PROCESSING`.
5. [ ] for any other status, raise an `Exception`:

```bash
unknown export status
```

> Tip: It's better if you try this challenge without using loops for practice, but you may use loops.
